# Telegram IV Templates

As you may know, Telegram has an instant view engine or IV that helps users view the content of a link easily in their Telegram app. It also caches the content so the content will be in access quickly. In this repo, I want to share some templates that I've built in the past.

## How can we test and manipulate templates?

Go to the https://instantview.telegram.org webiste. There you can find precise insturuction on how you can create templates. In a nutshel, 
```
1. Go to my templates
2. Enter an URL
3. Make a template for it and, in real-time, see how it would be looks like
4. Submit it for global publishment
